# Fuse Tags with Firebase
Example of [Jake´s app](https://github.com/yupferris/fuse-example-using-parse) using Firebase instead of Parse through REST API.


# Setup

You can use my Firebase but if you want to use your own:

1) Create an account with Firebase (www.firebase.com)

2) Create an app and add a name & value

3) Copy the link to that file and update it on the Javascript.
Line 17 and 42.

That´s it. 
Have fun!

Shout-out to [Jake](https://github.com/yupferris) for the help.


UPDATE: This example has been updated to use in Fuse 0.21
