# Fuse Tags with Firebase
Example of Jake´s app using Firebase instead of Parse through REST API.
(https://github.com/yupferris/fuse-example-using-parse)

# Setup

You can use my Firebase but if you want to use your own:

1) Create an account with Firebase (www.firebase.com)

2) Create an app and add a name & value

3) Copy the link to that file and update it on the Javascript.
Line 17 and 42.

That´s it. 
Have fun!

Shout-out to Jake (https://github.com/yupferris)for the help.
